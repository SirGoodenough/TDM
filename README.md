#  TDM
This is based on a docker compose I found from :
https://zorruno.com/w/TDMDocker

That was based on a docker compose from here that now appears abandoned:
https://hub.docker.com/r/marcelkordek/tasmota-device-manager

I have added a few things to make it work better for general users.

## Installation:

* First install DockerCE and Docker Compose as stated on the Docker Website.  That installation is not covered here as it is out of scope.  
* Once that is installed, create a folder /opt/TDM and change the user and group on this folder /opt/TDM to be the [non-root user] that will be running the container on this computer.
* Create a docker group if there isnâ€™t one:  *sudo groupadd docker*
* Add your user to the docker group:  *sudo usermod -aG docker [non-root user]*
* Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
* Install all the files from the repository as your [non-root user] entity.
* Inside /opt/TDM build the containers:  *sudo docker-compose build*
* If you are using Ubuntu, copy the 2 xxx.desktop files to your [non-root user] entity's home folder.

## Container Start-up:

You should be able to start and stop the container now with these desktop icons.  It you wish to start and stop the containers another way that is up to you, but be aware that the TDMGR container **SHOULD NOT be left running all the time**.  It does put extra IO's on the little ESP chips in the Tasmota Devices and on some, it will cause ghost switching and device reboots.  It is best to load the container, do your business, then when you are done stop the container.  The Terminal window that pops up while the container is running is for troubleshooting and to remind you that the container is running, so that you remember to turn it off when done.

## TDMGR Usage:

To use TDMGR, start the container, then connect to (http://127.0.0.1:5810) thru your web browser.  You will need to connect to your broker and make sure your topics and stuff is set up correctly as per the [TDMGR Github](https://github.com/jziolkowski/tdm).  Once the topics are set, browser credentials are set, and you connect to the broker, your Tasmota devices should start showing up.

## Troubleshooting and Warnings:

If you have problems getting this to work correctly, you can put an issue here and contact me at my Discord and I will do my best to help you.  Be warned that TDMGR is intended to be run native and all testing is done on Ubuntu as per the [TDMGR Github](https://github.com/jziolkowski/tdm), so if you can't get it to run in this container, try it native on Ubuntu.  This set-up is for advanced users that can puzzle things out for themselves.
